README file of analysis indoor climate data.

The project was to analyse some indoor climate data of a factory.


The reason was that the attic spaces of the facilties had bad climate conditions so mould was developing.

The data gathering consisted of 15+ sensors located throughout the facilities to get a comprehensive model of the climate conditions.

I got a good overview of the different stages of a data analysis project. Collection and quality, cleaning and wrangling, explorative analysis, statistical tools and visualisation. Additionally, I got to develop a practical intuition of what methods and structures to use for the application.

It's been a great learning experience, since many mistakes were made along the way, and I got to analyse some real world data. Feel free to bring it up and I'll happily share some off my experiences.
